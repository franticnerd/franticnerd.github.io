But success stories of existing text mining and natural language processing tools still rely on excessive labeled data, which are often too costly to obtain in practice. The goal of this project is to develop next-generation text mining methods that turn massive text data into actionable knowledge with limited human supervision. We study an array of fundamental text mining tasks, such as text classification, event extraction, and taxonomy construction. Departing from prevailing supervised models for these tasks, our methods require little human supervision yet still achieve inspiring performance.\nRepresentative publications:\n Weakly-Supervised Neural Text Classification, CIKM 2018 Doc2Cube: Automated Document Allocation to Text Cube via Dimension-Aware Joint Embedding, ICDM 2018 TaxoGen: Unsupervised Topic Taxonomy Construction by Adaptive Term Embedding and Clustering, KDD 2018 HiExpan: Task-Guided Taxonomy Construction by Hierarchical Tree Expansion, KDD 2018 GeoBurst: Real-Time Local Event Detection in Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams, SIGIR 2016 TrioVecEvent: Embedding-Based Online Local Event Detection in Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams, KDD 2017  Combining the above pieces, we have also developed the TextCube system, which facilitates on-demand text mining and learning with little human labeling effort.

Existing text mining and spatiotemporal data mining techniques operate separately and quickly become obsolete in dealing with such complex data. How do we unveil the subtle correlations between different modalities? How do we discover interesting patterns in the multidimensional space? Can we integrate different modalities to make more accurate predictions? In this project, we strive to connect multiple modalities (text, space, time) in a principled way, thus improving predictive analysis and decision making in context-rich scenarios. We study several key problems such as cross-modal prediction and multimodal sequential prediction in this pursuit.\nRepresentative publications:\n Regions, Periods, Activities: Uncovering Urban Dynamics via Cross-Modal Representation Learning, WWW 2017\n ReAct: Online Multimodal Embedding for Recency-Aware Spatiotemporal Activity Modeling, SIGIR 2017 Splitter: Mining Fine-Grained Sequential Patterns in Semantic Trajectories, VLDB 2014 GMove: Group-Level Mobility Modeling Using Geo-Tagged Social Media, KDD 2016 DeepMove: Predicting Human Mobility with Attentional Recurrent Networks, WWW 2018 Bringing Semantics to Spatiotemporal Data Mining: Challenges, Methods, Applications, ICDE 2017  You may be also interested in playing with the Urbanity system we have developed.
