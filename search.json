But success stories of existing text mining and natural language processing tools still rely on excessive labeled data, which are often too costly to obtain in practice. The goal of this project is to develop next-generation text mining methods that turn massive text data into actionable knowledge with limited human supervision. We study an array of fundamental text mining tasks, such as text classification, event extraction, and taxonomy construction. Departing from prevailing supervised models for these tasks, our methods require little human supervision yet still achieve inspiring performance.\nRepresentative publications:\n Weakly-Supervised Neural Text Classification, CIKM 2018 Doc2Cube: Automated Document Allocation to Text Cube via Dimension-Aware Joint Embedding, ICDM 2018 TaxoGen: Unsupervised Topic Taxonomy Construction by Adaptive Term Embedding and Clustering, KDD 2018 HiExpan: Task-Guided Taxonomy Construction by Hierarchical Tree Expansion, KDD 2018 GeoBurst: Real-Time Local Event Detection in Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams, SIGIR 2016 TrioVecEvent: Embedding-Based Online Local Event Detection in Geo-Tagged Tweet Streams, KDD 2017  Combining the above pieces, we have also developed the TextCube system, which facilitates on-demand text mining and learning with little human labeling effort.

If you have questions, please ask it on Piazza first because 1) other students may have the same question; 2) you will get help faster compared to sending emails.\n If it\u0026rsquo;s something you do not like to discuss publicly on Piazza, send an email with CX4240 in the subject.\n  Grading  Assignments (50%)\n There will be four assignments. Each one is designed for testing your understanding of the taught algorithms. It could be either programming or written analysis. You will need to hand in the assignments at the beginning of the class on the due date. All assignments follow the \u0026ldquo;no-late\u0026rdquo; policy. Assignments received after the due time will receive zero credit. All students are expected to follow the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code.  Project (20%)\n You are expected to complete a project on computational data analysis with real-life data. Your project needs to be clear about 1) the data you are using; 2) the problem you are attempting to solve; 3) the method you are using; 4) the results and conclusion you attain. You will need to turn in a project report and also give an in-class presentation for your project. The project report and the presentation will each count for 10% of your final grade. Each project needs to be completed in a team of 2-4 people. Team members need to clearly claim their contributions in the project report.  Class participation (5%)\n Your class participation score will be graded based on attendance and in-class quizzes. Participation in class discussions (including asking relevant questions in class, volunteering to answer questions on Piazza) will be considered when determining your final grade. It will be especially useful when you are right on the edge of two letter grades.  Midterm Exam (10%)\n The midterm exam will take place on Feb 25th in lieu of the regular class. The midterm exam will be a written and open-book exam, but Internet usage will not be allowed. There will be no make-up exams. You will get zero credit for your missed midterm exam.  Final Exam (15%)\n The final exam will be at whatever time is scheduled for this class. The final exam will be a written and open-book exam, but no Internet usage will be allowed. Again, there will be no make-up exams. You will get zero credit for your missed final exam.

Existing text mining and spatiotemporal data mining techniques operate separately and quickly become obsolete in dealing with such complex data. How do we unveil the subtle correlations between different modalities? How do we discover interesting patterns in the multidimensional space? Can we integrate different modalities to make more accurate predictions? In this project, we strive to connect multiple modalities (text, space, time) in a principled way, thus improving predictive analysis and decision making in context-rich scenarios. We study several key problems such as cross-modal prediction and multimodal sequential prediction in this pursuit.\nRepresentative publications:\n Regions, Periods, Activities: Uncovering Urban Dynamics via Cross-Modal Representation Learning, WWW 2017\n ReAct: Online Multimodal Embedding for Recency-Aware Spatiotemporal Activity Modeling, SIGIR 2017 Splitter: Mining Fine-Grained Sequential Patterns in Semantic Trajectories, VLDB 2014 GMove: Group-Level Mobility Modeling Using Geo-Tagged Social Media, KDD 2016 DeepMove: Predicting Human Mobility with Attentional Recurrent Networks, WWW 2018 Bringing Semantics to Spatiotemporal Data Mining: Challenges, Methods, Applications, ICDE 2017  You may be also interested in playing with the Urbanity system we have developed.
