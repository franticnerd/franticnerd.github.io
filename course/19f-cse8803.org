* Overview

This course will introduce state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for
mainstay problems in text data analysis, with particular emphasis on deep
learning methods that have achieved enormous success recently. Students will
learn about trending problems in this field, key methods for solving these
problems, and their advantages and disadvantages. The course will provide
useful techniques for students who want to solve practical problems involving
text data, and better prepare those who want to do edge-cutting research in
text mining, information retrieval, natural language processing, and text-rich
interdisciplinary research. The learning objective is that by the end of this
course, the students are able to formulate their text analysis problems at
hand, choose appropriate statistical models for the problems, and even come up
with innovative solutions for solving open research problems in this field.

In the task space, we will cover a range of text data analysis tasks,
including:

- Text classification (sentiment analysis, document classification)
- Sequence labeling (POS tagging, NER, event extraction)
- Knowledge graph construction and reasoning
- Text generation (text summarization, image captioning)
- A number of other trending topics in this area.


In the methodology space, we will introduce state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques for these problems, including:

- Deep representation learning (Word2Vec, Transformer, BERT)
- Sequence labeling models (CRF, LSTM-CRF) 
- Deep transfer/multi-task learning
- Neural symbolic methods
- Deep generative models (GAN, VAE, and their variants)


Prerequisites for this course: (1) the students should be have basic knowledge
in machine learning and taken a relevant course before (e.g., CX4240, CSE6740,
CS4641); (2) the students should have solid programming skills---both the
assignments and the course project can be programming demanding.

* Grading

- Homeworks (45%)
  - There will be three assignments. Each one is designed for testing your understanding of the taught algorithms. It could be either programming or written analysis.
  - All assignments follow the "no-late" policy. Assignments received after the due time will receive zero credit.
  - All students are expected to follow the [[http://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code][Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code]].
- Project (50%)
  - You are expected to complete a project on machine learning for text data. Your project needs to be clear about 1) the problem you are attempting to solve; 2) a survey of existing literature for the problem and the technical method you propose to solve the problem; 3) the results and conclusion you attain.
  - Each project needs to be completed in a team of 2-3 people. Team members need to clearly claim their contributions in the project report.
  - You will need to submit the following: 
    - Project proposal (10%): formulation of the problem and expected outcome
    - Mid-term report (10%): literature survey and technical roadmap
    - Presentation (15%): group-wise in-class project presentation
    - Final report (15%): a complete and final project report
- Class participation (5%)
  - Your class participation score will be graded based on attendance and in-class quizzes. 
  - Participation in class discussions (including asking relevant questions in class, volunteering to answer questions on Piazza) will be considered when determining your final grade. It will be especially useful when you are right on the edge of two letter grades.
